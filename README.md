## :information_source: About

The iWeather is a powerful app designed to level up my skills in automated testing for mobile applications. With the ever-increasing demand for robust and bug-free mobile apps, it's crucial to ensure your code is rock-solid from the start.

React Native-Powered: My app is developed using the versatile and widely-adopted React Native framework, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience on both iOS and Android devices.

Jest Integration: The iWeather integrates seamlessly with Jest, the JavaScript testing framework, enabling you to write and execute automated tests with ease. Jest simplifies the testing process, making it accessible to everyone.

I created a comprehensive set of test scenarios and cases to cover various aspects of this mobile app, including UI/UX, functionality, API requests, and more. Use these tests as a foundation for your projects or customize them to fit your specific needs.
